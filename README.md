# python_challenge
Homework for Module3
I was not able to figure out how to get the dates on the pybank challenge.

It took me almost two weeks to get it done and I had to hurry up and get it done before the dealine. I used code from screenshots posted by other people in class and help from different internet sources as well as bing chatbot.

Once I had finally finished the pybank analysis it made completing the pypoll analysis easier. I pretty much copied most of the structure from the pybank code and after some research online I was able to get the right way to write the code for the candidate votes and percentages.
